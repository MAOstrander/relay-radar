#StreetPass Relay Radar
###Companion site for the Nintendo 3DS family

This was my Front-End Capstone for Nashville Software School, but I will continue to work and develop it as a side project

Main Goals:
To heighten a 3DS user's experience by providing a support site for games and to find friends.
To create a user generated map of StreetPass Relays (usable whether or not you log in)
Each user that logs in gets a unique screenname and profile with your games, goals, info, or whatever you choose to share.
You can view others shared profile information and add them as friends
Friends can message each other to combine game efforts, coordinate StreetPasses, or just have fun!

Next Steps:
Ability to delete messages from other users
Make a 'provisional friend' section until they are confirmed.
Add info-windows to the markers
Ability to check into particular relays
Sorting friends/others based on profile information
